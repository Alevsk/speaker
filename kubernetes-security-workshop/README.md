# Kubernetes Security: Hands-On Attack and Defense

## Elevator Pitch

Designed for all skill levels, this workshop provides a solid understanding of Kubernetes Security. By simulating red team offensive tactics and blue team defensive strategies, you will learn to exploit and mitigate risks such as cluster misconfigurations, secrets leaks, and container escapes.

## Description

Kubernetes is the de facto operating system of the cloud, and more and more organizations are running their workloads on Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers many benefits, new users may introduce security risks like cluster misconfiguration, leaked credentials, cryptojacking, container escapes, and vulnerable clusters.

This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of Kubernetes security, from protecting your cluster to securing your workloads. You'll learn about RBAC, OPA, Security Contexts, Network Policies, and other security features. You'll also learn how to exploit workloads running on a Kubernetes environment using Living Off the Land (LotL) techniques like exploiting Insecure APIs, Secrets Theft, Container Escape and Pod Privilege Escalation, similar to the ones used by real-world threat actors.

This workshop is designed for both beginners and advanced students. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a deep understanding of Kubernetes security and the skills to protect your clusters and workloads
