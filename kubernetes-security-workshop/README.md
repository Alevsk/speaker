# Kubernetes Security: Hands-On Attack and Defense

## Description

Kubernetes is the de facto operating system of the cloud, and more and more organizations are running their workloads on Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers many benefits, it also introduces new security risks, such as cluster misconfiguration, leaked credentials, cryptojacking, container escapes, and vulnerable clusters.

This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of Kubernetes security, from protecting your cluster to securing your workloads. You'll learn about RBAC, OPA, security contexts, network policies, and other security features. You'll also learn how to exploit workloads running on a Kubernetes cluster using techniques like container escape, similar to the ones used by real-world threat actors.

This workshop is designed for both beginners and advanced students. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a deep understanding of Kubernetes security and the skills to protect your clusters and workloads
