# Container Security

## Description

Containers have become a cornerstone of modern software development and deployment. However, understanding their security implications is crucial in an era where data breaches and vulnerabilities are ever-present concerns. We'll start by exploring the fundamental concept that containers are fundamentally just efficient processes. They make use of key components in the Linux operating system, like namespaces and cgroups, to manage isolation. This technical exploration will help you grasp that containers are, at their core, nothing more than well-managed processes.

By the end of this talk, you'll have a solid grasp of container security. You'll be well-prepared to effectively deploy, manage, and secure your containers, ensuring their resilience in the face of potential security threats.
