# The Four Tiers of Homelabs: My Approach to Learn Cybersecurity

## Elevator Pitch

The Four Tiers of Homelabs is a methodology for learning cybersecurity by setting up a home network and experimenting with different security tools and techniques. It is a practical approach that can help beginners build a holistic understanding of cybersecurity.

## Description

I always struggle to answer the question “How do I get a job in cybersecurity?” because there is no secret formula to prepare yourself for your first job in security. To acquire the knowledge and hard skills, people often recommend getting entry-level certifications, playing capture the flags, or even going back to school. There is no right or wrong answer, as the journey into cybersecurity is different for everyone. In my case, I prefer a more practical approach: homelabs.

Looking back at my own career, I put together the pieces that allowed me to build a holistic understanding of cybersecurity. The four tiers of homelabs for learning cybersecurity is a methodology I came up with for introducing beginners to the necessary concepts, skills, and tools they need to learn to be proficient in cybersecurity, from basic topics like being aware of the different Linux distributions to advanced ones like cryptography and cloud security.

Divided into four steps, I provide practical examples of projects I implemented myself over the years to gain experience and learn the different security tools and platforms companies use in real life, right in my own homelab.

In this talk, I will share my unique approach on how I learned security engineering over the years by using homelabs and project-based learning to finally land my dream job as a Security Engineer.

Homelabs are a great way to learn cybersecurity because they allow you to practice in a safe environment. You can set up your own network and experiment with different security tools and techniques. This is a great way to learn the basics of cybersecurity and to get hands-on experience.

The four tiers of homelabs are:

- **Tier 1**: Getting Started with Virtualization
  
  A foundational homelab system using basic virtualization on a single machine.

- **Tier 2**: Expanding Horizons with Dedicated Hardware

  Building expertise with dedicated machines, exploring various operating systems, and automating tasks in a Tier 2 homelab.

- **Tier 3**: Becoming the Household IT Department

  Transitioning into managing critical services for others, implementing high availability, and delving into advanced networking and security in a Tier 3 homelab.

- **Tier 4**: Mastering the Art of Homelab Engineering

  Achieving a sophisticated homelab infrastructure with multi/hybrid cloud setups, advanced security practices, and a comprehensive understanding of IT and security engineering in a Tier 4 homelab.

Each tier builds on the previous one, so you can start at the beginning and work your way up. The projects I have included in this talk are from all four tiers, so you can choose the ones that are most relevant to your interests and experience level.

## Who should attend

While there’s no minimum required experience to attend, this talk will best suited for:

- Students
- Software Engineers
- Security Engineers
- Cloud Engineers
- DevOps people
- Any person that wants to learn more about cybersecurity and security engineering
